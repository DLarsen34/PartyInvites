# PartyInvites
This project was a good way to get to know how to do certain things in ASP.NET core web applications, as well as a great refresher on CSS
and some HTML elements that I will use through out this course. Overall I enjoyed the project and enjoyed reading the chapter and plan on
going back and re-reading it to get an even better grasp on the material.
